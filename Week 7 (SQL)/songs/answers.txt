FROM songs;

 I have this information a little bit higher at this file from database
 songs, so my thoughts about one listener that is he like an very average person
 because all of average energy, valence, and danceability are about 0.5 -
 average at all.

 But this aura won't be representative for real, because I find this
 information for average value of millions of customers. In real life we'll have
 a lot of different information for every customer.
